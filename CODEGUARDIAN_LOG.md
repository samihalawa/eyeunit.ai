# CodeGuardian Log - Current Status: UNSTABLE

## Initial Analysis
- Purpose: Static website for eyeunit.ai showcasing AI-powered ophthalmology solutions
- Technologies: Express.js (server), Static HTML/CSS/JS (frontend), Playwright (testing)
- User Flow: Users can navigate through pages about solutions, technologies, research, and blog posts
- UI: Static pages with navigation between different sections

## User-Visible Issues
- [x] Navigation test failing due to duplicate navigation elements (mobile and desktop) - FIXED
- [x] Solutions page has confusing heading hierarchy - FIXED by making "AI-Powered Eye Care Solutions" the main h1
- [x] Static assets not loading - FIXED by adding missing CDN resources to solutions.html
- [ ] Blog post content not loading - blogPosts.js is not included in blog/index.html

## Fix Log
1. Fixed navigation test to handle both mobile and desktop navigation elements
2. Fixed Solutions page heading hierarchy:
   - Made "AI-Powered Eye Care Solutions" the main h1 heading
   - Changed secondary heading to "Transform Your Practice"
   - Improved clarity and accessibility of the page structure
3. Fixed static asset loading in solutions.html:
   - Added missing CDN preconnects
   - Added missing JavaScript libraries
   - Added resource hints for external services
   - Added favicon links
   - Added preload directives for critical assets
4. Found issue with blog functionality:
   - blogPosts.js is not included in blog/index.html
   - Blog container element with id="blogPosts" is missing
   - Blog post content won't load without these fixes

## Hypotheses
1. Blog content won't appear because blogPosts.js is not loaded
2. Blog container is missing from the HTML
3. Blog post links will 404 because individual post pages don't exist

## Current Task
Fixing blog functionality by:
1. Adding blogPosts.js script to blog/index.html
2. Adding blog posts container element
3. Creating individual blog post pages

## Simulation Results (Initial)
Issues found in blog/index.html:
```html
<!-- Missing script -->
<!-- <script src="/assets/js/blogPosts.js"></script> -->

<!-- Missing container -->
<!-- <div id="blogPosts" class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-8"></div> -->
```

## Simulation Results (Shadow)
*Pending shadow tests execution*

## System Environment
- OS: Windows 10 (win32 10.0.26100)
- Node.js with Express 4.18.2
- Development server on port 3000
- Static file serving enabled

## Iteration Summary
SILENT. NO OUTPUT. ONLY USER-FACING BUGS (100% REPRO). MINIMAL changes. NO refactoring. Version control, reverting. Log valid. NOT an assistant. Database, .env assumed valid.
